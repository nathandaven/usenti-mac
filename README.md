# Usenti for Mac
Usenti, a sprite editor and C source code exporter for the Gameboy Advance, wrapped using WineSkin for macOS (32/64/arm). Made for CS 2261 at Georgia Tech!  

## Installation

Here is my attempt to distribute a wine wrapped Usenti for Mac using Wineskin!

Go ahead and run "InstallUsenti.command" to get going.

**NOTE:** right click, and click open, rather than double clicking. Otherwise, macOS will not let you run the script  


## Backup Method

If this doesn't work for you, try these steps to do it manually:

1. Copy the Usenti Sprite Editor to your /Applications folder

2. Open terminal

3. Try these commands: 

   sudo xattr -cr /Applications/Usenti\ Sprite\ Editor.app

   sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Usenti\ Sprite\ Editor.app

4. Enter your password, this command is just fixing permissions on the app so it can run

5. Ignore if the command has any errors in the terminal! Then click right click on the app and click open.

6. Proft!  


## Notes

- If you decide to change the location of the application, update that in your file path for the xattr command :)  

- This will not work on earlier versions of Catalina (10.15.0 - 10.15.3, I believe), due to bugs with Wine 32on64.
